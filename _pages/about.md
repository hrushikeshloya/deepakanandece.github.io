My name is Hrushikesh Loya, and I am an Undergraduate in the [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web) at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/). I am pursuing my Master's thesis in the domain of Bioinformatics, more specifically data driven cancer research at MeDAL (Medical Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence Lab). I have worked in the area of Computational Biology, Systems Biology and Machine Learning. I also have a keen interest in the field of Deep learning, Bayesian Inference and AI Safety.

I maintain a list of my publications and research implementations under the [Publications]({{ site.url }}/publications) tab. To get an insight into my professional life so far, you can have a look at my [CV](/images/Hrushikesh_Loya_IITB_CV.pdf).
