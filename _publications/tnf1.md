Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα) is a pleiotropic
cytokine involved in phenotypic decisions such as
apoptotic/necrotic death, proliferation. Aberrant TNFα
signaling is implicated in numerous pathological
conditions. Designing therapeutic strategies to modulate
these conditions require insights into the mechanisms
governing context-specific phenotypic response to TNFα.
Signal transduction culminating in such responses is
orchestrated by underlying molecular network of nodes
interconnected by edges. Using a comprehensive, well-
annotated, manually curated TNF-α signaling network,
we show that a graph-theory based dimensionality
reduction via modularization can lead to functionally
consistent, conserved modules in the network. We
identify 19 candidates which when knocked down one-at-
a-time significantly disturbs the network robustness yet
preserves network modularity. Boolean dynamic
simulations and attractor analysis of the underlying state
transition graph show that targeting cIAP1/2 and MKRN1
can lead to reliable phenotype switching from
proliferation to apoptosis. Knocking off BAX-BAK and
LUBAC may result in switching from apoptosis to
proliferation. These combinations causing phenotype
switching could be potential targets for TNFα based
therapeutic strategies.
